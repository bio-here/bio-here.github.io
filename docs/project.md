# About Bio-Here

We have written a number of tools and software to suit our needs when doing bioinformatics related work.
We use `Rust` as our main programming language because of its convenient `Cargo` and active community.
We can easily write safe and fast software.

Against this background, ***Bio-Here*** was born, which is a collection of Bio-Here software that is still being refined.

Below are the programs currently included in Bio-Here:

## Projects

- [Seq-Here](../zh/project/seq-here.md): A fast tool for processing bio-informatics sequences.

- [Placecare](../zh/project/placecare.md): A tool for searching cis-acting elements using the PLACE database.
